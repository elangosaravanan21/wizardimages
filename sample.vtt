The Continuing Presence Of The Past

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.400
Jeff Koons' <i>Louis XIV</i>

3
00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.733
Jeff Koons <b>rose to
prominence</b> in the mid-1980s

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.100
by <sub>creating works
featuring consumer</sub> goods,

5
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.066
principally <u> vacuum cleaners</u> ,

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.166
<i>encased in acrylic boxes</i>
(and therefore made unusable)

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.833
as if they were fine art.

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.566
"When I'm working
with an object,"

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.266
Koons said in an interview in the
<i>Journal of Contemporary Art</i> in 1986,

10
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.533
the same year that he created
his sculpture of <i>Louis XIV</i>,

11
00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.033
"I always have to give
the greatest consideration

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.166
not to alter
the object physically

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.933
or even psychologically.

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.733
I try to reveal a certain aspect
of the object's personality.

15
00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.333
To give you an example:

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.966
if you place a shy person
in a large crowd,

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.700
his shyness will be
revealed and enhanced.

18
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.500
I work with the object
in a very similar manner.

19
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.566
I'm placing the object
in a context or material

20
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.933
that will enhance a specific
personality trait within the object.

21
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.666
The soul of the object
must be maintained."

22
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.966
Koons' sculpture of Louis XIV

23
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.366
effectively uncrates
for modernity

24
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.100
the king whom workers
are putting into storage

25
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.866
in Watteau's
<i>The Signboard of Gersaint.</i>

26
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.433
The hairstyle of
Louis XIV in Koons' work

27
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.466
is the same
that Hyacinthe Rigaud

28
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.100
captured in his 1701 portrait
of the king, except that,

29
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.566
in emphasizing its curls,
the hair on Koon's Louis

30
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.066
reflects the S and C
tendril-like scrolls of the Rococo.

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600
"I went back and I embraced
the Rococo and the Baroque,"

32
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.633
Koons has explained,

33
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:38.033
"to show how materialism was used
in objective art before modernism.

34
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.533
And I showed that whomever you
put in political control of art,

35
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.733
it becomes reflective
of their ego,

36
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.900
and eventually
becomes decorative."

37
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.800
It might be said
of Koons' sculpture,

38
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.433
to paraphrase Koons himself,

39
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:52.966
that if you represent an authoritarian
person in polished metal,

40
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.033
his authoritarian character
will be revealed and enhanced.

41
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700
The material (stainless steel),

42
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:04.266
underscores the king's authoritarian
personality and his power.

43
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.400
But, of course,
stainless steel is a material

44
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.000
that would not be invented
until the twentieth century.

45
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.466
It is a distinctly modern material
and, in stainless steel,

46
00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.500
Louis XIV suddenly seems
to more closely resemble

47
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.333
some long-haired
1970s rock star,

48
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.900
such as Led Zeppelin's
Robert Plant,

49
00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:24.266
than the French king.

50
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:28.600
In fact, what Koons' sculpture
suggests is that power today

51
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.000
is as firmly rooted in
the "image" of the star

52
00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:35.100
as it ever was in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries

53
00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.333
in the image of the king.
