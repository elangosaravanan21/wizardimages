00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video I willl

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
explain how to build a third-party

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
interactive new window widget,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Which is basically a button that will launch a third-party

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
interactive into a new window or browser tab.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you are looking on how to build a

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
widget third-party interactive widget that

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is embedded in an iframe, check out the 3PI

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
inline section.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So&#8230; um&#8230; just like any other widget youâre gonna drag it

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
into your project and name your

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
widget&#8230; um&#8230; You are allowed

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to decide what you want the button to say

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can have it say whatever you want it to say.

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Iâm just going to say &#8220;View.&#8221;

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then you get to decide what you want the descriptive

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
text next to the button to say

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[typing sounds]&#8230; And then you

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
enter in your URL. Make sure that your URL

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is using HTTPS,

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
not HTTPâ¦ um, Save the

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
link. Youâll see it will tell you that it has saved.

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And then you can go to preview widget to preview your button.

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And note that this appears to be in

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
an iframe, but that will not be how it looks

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
once you get into your project. Itâll just be a

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
button with the text that you have decided upon.

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And when you click on the button, it will launch

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:00:00.000
the third-party interactive.
